# Ogaya

Ogaya is an off-Google-account Youtube aggregator. It is designed as a backfire to Youtube's decision to "upgrade" [GDATA/RSS support](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6098135?hl=en).

It is essentially HTTP parsers and some Python objects to manipulate Youtube channels and videos.

Ogaya-CLI is a shell-like client for Ogaya.

## Requirements
